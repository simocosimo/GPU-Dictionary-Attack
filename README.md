# GPU accelerated Dictionary Attack against SHA-1 Hashed Passwords

This work presents a possible strategy to perform fast and effective dictionary attacks against SHA-1 hashed passwords. The software, developed using the CUDA framework and running on GPGPUs, performs the hashing of every word present in a dictionary of commonly used passwords and compares it to a target hash.
